The PiWiBot is a small, mobile, educational robot using the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller board.
The original code and inspiration for the software was developed and shared by Adrian Cruceru as "crawlspacebot". https://github.com/AdrianCX/crawlspacebot 

The printed circuit board is available from PCBWAY at https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/PiWiBot_One_51645550.html 
Or you can manufacture your own, single sided board using the files included here.

The board is compatible with the "Tethered Mini Sumo" project.. a common "Tech Studies" project in British Columbia. https://botshop.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/tethered-mini-sumo-robots/ 
The entire robot, as presented here, can be manufactured for approximately $20CAD (batteries not included!) as of October 2024

To install the software, install Thonny on your computer and use it to copy the MicroPython image to your Raspberry Pi Pico W, using the instructions here: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico/2 

Copy the code in the Code folder to a folder on your computer. Open the code in Thonny, and then save to the Pico W.
